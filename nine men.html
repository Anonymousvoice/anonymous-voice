    <h2>Myth or Reality</h2>
<div class="journaal">
    <p>The old brazen theories of world domination and conspiracies when combined with extra dosage of secrecies can stir the utmost curiosity within you.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, it appeals to most of us.</p>
     <p> And the alluring idea that beyond our conventional understanding, there exists some unknown influential forces at action, with ancient secrets acquired far from our reach. Hidden under shadows and potentially guarding the world from destructive knowledge, one such alleged secretive society is India’s Ancient Illuminati: Nine Unknown Men.</p>
<p>Myth or Reality? We know nothing about. What we know is history is a combination of realities and deceits. In short, history illumes reality.</p>
<p>It was under the rein of vengeful Emperor Ashoka, when the destructive war was waging. The Emperor’s quest to conquer the region of Kalinga which lay between then Calcutta and Madras resulted in the brutal slaughter of over 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations, ending at around 200,000 deaths.  Legends state, he converted after witnessing the mass deaths of the war and became a stable and peaceful emperor stating that the true conquest is to win the hearts of men by the law of duty and virtue. </p>
<p>Knowing well what a destruction can result into when fallen into irreverent hands, his majesty wanted to prohibit the misuse of intelligence. In fact, he wanted to make sure that history shouldn’t repeat itself. That’s how came into existence, the most powerful society: The Nine Unknown Men.</p>
<p>What are the objectives of this society? To continue study so that it’s helpful to mankind. To keep the technical secrets far from our reach.</p>	
<p>  Each of these 9 men was entrusted with the charge of guarding, developing and preventing secret knowledge unknown to the word. They vowed to secrecy, never to get involved in political and social conflicts. They were tasked to guard one book each. These books were devoted to supremacy, even treasured secrets of science and technology which could have cause welfare to mankind, but if went into profane hands could destroy the entire world. </p>
<h4>Nine Books</h4>
<p>The first book is dedicated to techniques of propaganda and psychological warfare. This book would explain the rules of civilization and the techniques of molding mass opinion which will ultimately make anyone able to govern the whole world.”</p>
<p> “The second book dealt with physiology. It would include a way to kill a man by touching him, death occurring by reversal of nerve impulses.” It is believed that the art of judo is a result of leakages from this part.</p>

<p> “The third book discussed microbiology and biotechnology.” It would include the details of wave mechanisms to repair organs and muscles. Also, it would focus on properties of sound.</p> 
 <p>“The fourth study the transmutation of metals” and their secret properties such as hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, which played a major role in the invention of alchemy. Nevertheless, “Legend has it that at times of scarcity, temples and relief agencies receive secret source of large quantities of fine gold”</p>                                                                                  
<p>“The fifth book focused on all means of communication, terrestrial and extraterrestrial.” It also includes not only the study of teleportation – but also details all the ancient and modern media -including existence of aliens. </p>
<p> “The sixth comprises the secrets of gravitation.” Thy study explains ways to remove weight to heavier loads, which would have helped them to build all the cyclopean walls and pyramids.</p>
<p>“The seventh is the largest cosmogony designed by our humanity.” The book also talks about the matters of universe.</p>
<p>“The eighth deal of light.” Chiefly, it explicates the use of light and speed as weapons.</p>
<p>“The ninth and final would identify all the techniques to attain enlightenment … or simply discuss about sociology.” It would detail about the rules for the evolution of societies, a science we know nothing about.</p>
<p>It was the year 1923 when this secret society came into limelight by a book written by Talbot Mundy “The Nine Unknown”. The society might have disappeared into history in the similar way as the reign of Ashoka Maurya who was almost forgotten by the historians of the early British.</p>
<p>The idea of secret societies has always been about preservation of supremacy. To know the truth of history is to realize its ultimate myth and its inevitable ambiguity.</p>
<p>It’s completely up to you to believe in or not-a myth is far truer than history, for history only gives a story of shadows, whereas myth gives a story of the substances that cast shadows. </p>
