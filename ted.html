    <h1>Ted talks</h1>
    <h2>Ideas worth spreading</h2>
    <p>What if you found out that your own words and ideas are inflicting wonders somewhere in the other side of the world?</p>
    <p>They might be.  </p>
     <p> Then at some point, you realize that your brain contains thousands of them, however no right platform to exhibit them.</p>
<p>Your idea might be big--the kind everyone will instantly understand and get elated.</p>
<p>But guess what? Your efforts might go in vain. </p>
<p>How awful, right?</p>
<p>Only if, you had a right platform…</p>	
<p> Spreading good ideas, especially in an era when the entire world is connected can result in untold consequences. TED is such a platform where everyone with passion and something to say would love to share it.</p>
<h4>TED, the world’s prime speaking platform:</h4>
<p>TED mainly dedicated to Technology, Entertainment and Design is owned by a nonprofit foundation under moniker “ideas worth spreading”. Back when, TED was an annual conference, online video surfaced into life as feasible medium. That’s how TED no longer was just a conference but an engine for sharing talks for free globally.</p>
<p>Ones who now know TED know it best from these 18 minutes or less TED talks. Since then TED has grown from a few thousand talks viewed every day to more than 3 million.</p>
<h4>You too can...</h4>
<p>Almost anybody with experience worth sharing can. </p> 
 <p>Let’s shift our focus to TEDx. </p>                                                                                  
<p>TEDx is a self-organized program that brings inspiring voices together to share a TED-like experience. Whether TED or TEDx conference, you can get a chance to be speaker yourself by first visiting the respective event page and then submit the form. Also, do have links of yourself speaking, so that the committee can get a sense of how you might do.</p>
<p>Then, all you need is </p>
<p><ul>
<li> 	•18minutes or less</li>
<li>•A topic</li>
<li>•And an audience</li>


</ul>
</p>
<p>And lot of rehearse sections…</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how often or how rarely you frequently speak in public, the act of trying to give a talk in the tradition of TED will change your point of view about the public speaking. Overall, the speaker connects with the audience—possibly through humor, stories, or simply by speaking frankly. It can be very hard for a speaker to comprehend how much he covers what audience don’t know.</p>
<p>But, it’s worth it.</p>
<p>You will explore things about yourself, and the world around you like never before.</p>
<h4>My suggestions:</h4>
<p>Here are some of my personal favorite TED talks which may shift you from being spectators to a desire to help change the world a little. As said an idea is the beginning points of all the fortune. </p>
<p>list </p>
<p>Stay on an incessant path of learning and exploring new ideas. Keep expanding your horizons and challenge your perceptions.</p>
